# Phase 5

Career Prep supports learners with interview readiness, job placement support and overarching career development. Learners are responsible for working to become fully employed by the end of their time at the Guild. Since each learnerâ€™s application and job search strategy may vary, learners are responsible for keeping track of their job-hunt progress.

## High Level Skills

In this phase you will:

- Start Interviewing
  - Practice realtime problem solving in mock technical interviews
    - data structures and algorithms
    - systems design
  - Create and refine all job search materials
  - Develop compensation negotiation skills
- Expand Your Career Network
  - Attend career development workshops
  - Attend meetups and hackathons
  - Obtain one or more mentors
  - Find engineers who will advocate for you from the inside

## Modules

- _P:_ [Job Offers, Compensation, and Negotiation](../../modules/Job-Offers-Compensation-and-Negotiation)
- _P:_ [Job Search and Networking](../../modules/Job-Search-and-Networking)
- _P:_ [Methodically Approaching Technical Interviews](../../modules/Methodically-Approaching-Technical-Interviews)
- _P:_ [System Design Interviews](../../modules/System-Design-Interviews)

## Accountabilities

There are two main activities that you should be engaging in when you're in P5. Everything else is _in service of_ these two activities:

### Interviewing

Like coding, interviewing is a skill. No amount of reading about interviewing, watching other people interview, or studying practice questions will prepare you. Again, just like coding, the only way to learn it is _to do it_. To that end, in addition to applying for jobs and (hopefully) landing an interview at a company that you like, you should apply for jobs that you _don't_ actually want. Why? To practice interviewing. After all, wouldn't you rather bomb five interviews in a row _with no consequence_?

Each week you should prioritize things as follows:

- Actively apply for jobs
  - Submit at least 10 applications per week to companies you _don't_ want to work for
  - Submit at least 5 applications per week to companies you want to work for
  - Find an external recruiter who will help get you interviews (check Quora for good recommendations)
  - Scheduled check-ins with our internal recruiter / career coach
- Prepare for technical interviews
  - Complete at least 1 mock interview per week
  - Complete at least 1 online interview challenge per week (e.g., [HackerRank][hackerrank], [Pramp][pramp], [interviewing.io][interviewing-io], [Refdash][refdash])
- Continue to develop technical skills
  - Keep shipping code every day (Open Source, echo, etc.)
  - Take on contract work, e.g.:
    - [Upwork][upwork]
    - [fiverr][fiverr]
  - Work on portfolio site

### Networking

The best way to get a job is to have an engineer who already works at a company advocate for you to join the team. Because you may not have ever held a job in this industry before, you most likely don't have an existing set of people who will advocate for you. Networking is all about finding and making connections with those people.

Here are the best ways to expand your network:

- Attend some [Tech Meetups][eastbay-tech-meetups]
- Participate in one or more hackathons ([Eventbrite][eventbrite-sfbay-hackathons] / [Meetup][meetup-sfbay-hackathons])
- Use LinkedIn to [expand your network](../../modules/Job-Search-and-Networking)


## Tracking Your Progress

At least once per week, you must update the [interview tracking spreadsheet][interview-tracking].

In addition, you should attend daily stand-ups and share your progress with your fellow learners, SEP, and Career Coach.
